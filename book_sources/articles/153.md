## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

```
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
```

**Examples:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Approach:**

We can do it in O(Logn) using Binary Search. If we take a closer look at the above examples, we can easily figure out the following pattern:

1. The minimum element is the only element whose previous is greater than it. If there is no previous element, then there is no rotation (the first element is minimum). We check this condition for the middle element by comparing it with (mid-1)’th and (mid+1)’th elements.
2. If the minimum element is not at the middle (neither mid nor mid + 1), then the minimum element lies in either the left half or right half. 
    1. If the middle element is smaller than the last element, then the minimum element lies in the left half
    2. Else minimum element lies in the right half.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
  public int findMin(int[] nums) {
    // If the list has just one element then return that element.
    if (nums.length == 1) {
      return nums[0];
    }

    // initializing left and right pointers.
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

    // if the last element is greater than the first element then there is no rotation.
    // e.g. 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 7. Already sorted array.
    // Hence the smallest element is first element. A[0]
    if (nums[right] > nums[0]) {
      return nums[0];
    }
    
    // Binary search way
    while (right >= left) {
      // Find the mid element
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

      // if the mid element is greater than its next element then mid+1 element is the smallest
      // This point would be the point of change. From higher to lower value.
      if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
        return nums[mid + 1];
      }

      // if the mid element is lesser than its previous element then mid element is the smallest
      if (nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]) {
        return nums[mid];
      }

      // if the mid elements value is greater than the 0th element this means
      // the least value is still somewhere to the right as we are still dealing with elements
      // greater than nums[0]
      if (nums[mid] > nums[0]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        // if nums[0] is greater than the mid value then this means the smallest value is somewhere to
        // the left
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
}
```
