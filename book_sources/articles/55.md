## 55. Jump Game

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

**Approach:**

We can track the maximum index that can be reached. The key to solve this problem is to find: 1) when the current position can not reach next position (return false) , and 2) when the maximum index can reach the end (return true).

The largest index that can be reached is: i + A[i].

Here is an example:

```
index 0 1 2 3 4
  A   3 2 1 0 4
 max  3 3 3 X
            max <= i && A[i] = 0
```

**Solution:**

```java
public boolean canJump(int[] A) {
    if(A.length <= 1)
        return true;
 
    int max = A[0]; //max stands for the largest index that can be reached.
 
    for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
        //if not enough to go to next
        if(max <= i && A[i] == 0) 
            return false;
 
        //update max    
        if(i + A[i] > max){
            max = i + A[i];
        }
 
        //max is enough to reach the end
        if(max >= A.length-1) 
            return true;
    }
 
    return false; // actually return false or true doesn't matter. this line of code would never be reached. 
}
```
