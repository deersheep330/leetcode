## 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

**Approach:**

```
Let count[i] be the number of unique binary search trees for i. 
The number of trees are determined by the number of subtrees which have different root node. For example,

i=0, count[0] = 1 // empty tree

i=1, count[1] = 1 // one tree

i=2, count[2] = count[0]*count[1] // 0 is root
              + count[1]*count[0] // 1 is root

i=3, count[3] = count[0]*count[2] // 1 is root
              + count[1]*count[1] // 2 is root
              + count[2]*count[0] // 3 is root

i=4, count[4] = count[0]*count[3] // 1 is root
              + count[1]*count[2] // 2 is root
              + count[2]*count[1] // 3 is root
              + count[3]*count[0] // 4 is root
..
..
..

i=n, count[n] = sum(count[0..k]*count[k+1...n]) 0 <= k < n-1

Use dynamic programming to solve the problem.
```

**Solution:**

```java
public int numTrees(int n) {
	int[] count = new int[n + 1];
 
	count[0] = 1;
	count[1] = 1;
 
	for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j <= i - 1; j++) {
			count[i] = count[i] + count[j] * count[i - j - 1];
		}
	}
 
	return count[n];
}
```
