## 169. Majority Element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times. (assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.)

**Approach:**

Majority Vote Algorithm

This problem can be solved in time of O(n) with constant space complexity. The basic idea is that the majority element can negate all other element's count.

**Solution:**

```java
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
    int result = 0, count = 0;
 
    for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++ ) {
        if(count == 0){
            result = nums[ i ];
            count = 1;
        }else if(result == nums[i]){
           count++;
        }else{
           count--;
        }
    }
 
    return result;
}
```
