## 171. Excel Sheet Column Number

Given a column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

```
column  column number
  A  ->  1
  B  ->  2
  C  ->  3
  ...
  Z  ->  26
  AA ->  27
  AB ->  28 
```

**Approach:**

The process is similar to binary to decimal conversion. 

For example, to convert AB, the formula is 26 * 1 + 2. 

As another example,
 
To convert CDA,

```
3 * 26 * 26 + 4 * 26 + 1
```

So it is very much similar to converting binary to decimal keeping the base as 26. 

Take the input as string and the traverse the input string from the left to right and calculate the result as follows: 

```
result = 26 * result + s[i] - 'A' + 1
```

**Solution:**

```java
class GFG
{
 
    // Returns resul when we pass title.
    static int titleToNumber(String s)
    {
        // This process is similar to
        // binary-to-decimal conversion
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            result *= 26;
            result += s.charAt(i) - 'A' + 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
     
    // Driver Code
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        System.out.print(titleToNumber("CDA"));
    }
}
```
