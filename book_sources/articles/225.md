## 225. Implement Stack using Queues

Approach #1 (Two Queues, push O(1), pop O(n))

Push

The new element is always added to the rear of queue q1 and it is kept as top stack element

Pop

We need to remove the element from the top of the stack. This is the last inserted element in q1. Because queue is FIFO (first in - first out) data structure, the last inserted element could be removed only after all elements, except it, have been removed. For this reason we need to maintain additional queue q2, which will serve as a temporary storage to enqueue the removed elements from q1. The last inserted element in q2 is kept as top. Then the algorithm removes the last element in q1. We swap q1 with q2 to avoid copying all elements from q2 to q1.

**Solution:**

```java
class MyStack {
    
    private Queue<Integer> q1 = new LinkedList<>();
    private Queue<Integer> q2 = new LinkedList<>();
    private int top;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyStack() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x onto stack. */
    public void push(int x) {
        q1.add(x);
        top = x;
    }
    
    /** Removes the element on top of the stack and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        while (q1.size() > 1) {
            top = q1.remove();
            q2.add(top);
        }
        int val = q1.remove();
        Queue<Integer> temp = q1;
        q1 = q2;
        q2 = temp;
        return val;
    }
    
    /** Get the top element. */
    public int top() {
        return top;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the stack is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return q1.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

**Follow-up:**

Approach #2 (Two Queues, push O(n), pop O(1))

Push

The algorithm inserts each new element to queue q2 and keep it as the top element. In case queue q1 is not empty (there are elements in the stack), we remove all elements from q1 and add them to q2. In this way the new inserted element (top element in the stack) will be always positioned at the front of q2. We swap q1 with q2 to avoid copying all elements from q2 to q1.

Pop

The algorithm dequeues an element from queue q1 and keeps front element of q1 as top.

```java
class MyStack {
    
    private Queue<Integer> q1 = new LinkedList<>();
    private Queue<Integer> q2 = new LinkedList<>();
    private int top;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyStack() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x onto stack. */
    public void push(int x) {
        q2.add(x);
        top = x;
        while (!q1.isEmpty()) {                
            q2.add(q1.remove());
        }
        Queue<Integer> temp = q1;
        q1 = q2;
        q2 = temp;
    }
    
    /** Removes the element on top of the stack and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        int val = q1.remove();
        if (!q1.isEmpty()) {
    	    top = q1.peek();
        }
        return val;
    }
    
    /** Get the top element. */
    public int top() {
        return top;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the stack is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return q1.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
