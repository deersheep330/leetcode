## 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

What is an happy number can be shown in the following example:

**Examples:** 

```
19 is a happy number
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

**Approach:**

A number will not be a Happy Number when it makes a loop in its sequence that is it touches a number in sequence which already been touched. So to check whether a number is happy or not, we can keep a set, if the same number occurs again we flag result as not happy.

**Solution:**

```java
static int isHappyNumber(int n)
{
    HashSet<Integer> st = new HashSet<>();
    while (1)
    {
        n = numSquareSum(n);
        if (n == 1)
            return true;
        if (st.contains(n))
            return false;
        st.add(n);
    }
}

static int numSquareSum(int n)
{
    int squareSum = 0;
    while (n!= 0)
    {
        squareSum += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
        n /= 10;
    }
    return squareSum;
}
```

**Follow-up:**

We can solve this problem without using extra space and that technique can be used in some other similar problems also. If we treat every number as a node and replacement by square sum digit as a link, then this problem is same as finding a loop in a linklist.

So as a proposed solution from the above link, we will keep two numbers slow and fast both initialize from a given number, slow is replaced one step at a time and fast is replaced two steps at a time. If they meet at 1, then the given number is Happy Number otherwise not.  

```java
class GFG {
  
    // Utility method to return sum of square of
    // digit of n
    static int numSquareSum(int n)
    {
        int squareSum = 0;
        while (n!= 0)
        {
            squareSum += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        }
        return squareSum;
    }
  
    //  method return true if n is Happy number
    static boolean isHappynumber(int n)
    {
        int slow, fast;
  
        //  initialize slow and fast by n
        slow = fast = n;
        do
        {
            //  move slow number
            // by one iteration
            slow = numSquareSum(slow);
  
            //  move fast number
            // by two iteration
            fast = numSquareSum(numSquareSum(fast));
        }
        while (slow != fast);
  
        //  if both number meet at 1,
        // then return true
        return (slow == 1);
    }
  
    //  Driver code to test above methods
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int n = 13;
        if (isHappynumber(n))
            System.out.println(n + " is a Happy number");
        else
            System.out.println(n + " is not a Happy number");
    }
}
```
