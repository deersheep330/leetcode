## 12. Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 

X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

**Approach:**

Store Letters used in Roman numerals and the corresponding numerical values in an array. Initialize a string builder, Now start checking if input number is >= highest roman numeral then add it to the string builder and reduce its corresponding value from the input number and if input number is < highest roman numeral then check with next highest roman numeral and repeat the process above till input number becomes 0. string builder will be our roman representation of input number.

**Solution:**

```java
public class IntegerToRoman {

    public static void integerToRoman(int num) {

        System.out.println("Integer: " + num);
        int[] values = {1000,900,500,400,100,90,50,40,10,9,5,4,1};
        String[] romanLiterals = {"M","CM","D","CD","C","XC","L","XL","X","IX","V","IV","I"};

        StringBuilder roman = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i=0;i<values.length;i++) {
            while(num >= values[i]) {
                num -= values[i];
                roman.append(romanLiterals[i]);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Roman: " + roman.toString());
        System.out.println("---------------------------------------------------");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        integerToRoman(25);
        integerToRoman(36);
        integerToRoman(1023);
        integerToRoman(542);
    }
}
```
