## 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

**Approach:**

By Sorting the array the efficiency of the algorithm can be improved. This efficient approach uses the two-pointer technique. Traverse the array and fix the first element of the triplet. Now use the Two Pointers algorithm to find the closest number to x – array[i]. Update the closest sum. Two-pointers algorithm take linear time so it is better than a nested loop.

**Algorithm:**

1. Sort the given array.
2. Loop over the array and fix the first element of the possible triplet, arr[i].
3. Then fix two pointers, one at I + 1 and the other at n – 1. And look at the sum, 
    1. If the sum is smaller than the sum we need to get to, we increase the first pointer.
    2. Else, If the sum is bigger, Decrease the end pointer to reduce the sum.
    3. Update the closest sum found so far.

**Solution:**

```java
public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        
    // Sort the array
    Arrays.sort(nums);
 
    // To store the closets sum
    int closestSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
 
    // Fix the smallest number among
    // the three integers
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)
    {
 
        // Two pointers initially pointing at
        // the last and the element
        // next to the fixed element
        int ptr1 = i + 1, ptr2 = nums.length - 1;
 
        // While there could be more pairs to check
        while (ptr1 < ptr2)
        {
 
            // Calculate the sum of the current triplet
            int sum = nums[i] + nums[ptr1] + nums[ptr2];
 
            // If the sum is more closer than
            // the current closest sum
            // special check for closestSum == Integer.MAX_VALUE to prevent target - closestSum from overflow
            if (closestSum == Integer.MAX_VALUE || (Math.abs(target - sum) < Math.abs(target - closestSum)))
            {
                closestSum = sum;
            }
 
            // If sum is greater then x then decrement
            // the second pointer to get a smaller sum
            if (sum > target)
            {
                ptr2--;
            }
 
            // Else increment the first pointer
            // to get a larger sum
            else
            {
                ptr1++;
            }
        }
    }
 
    // Return the closest sum found
    return closestSum;
        
}
```
