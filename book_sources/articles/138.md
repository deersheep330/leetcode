## 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

**Algorithm:**

Create the copy of node 1 and insert it between node 1 & node 2 in the original Linked List, create a copy of 2 and insert it between 2 & 3. Continue in this fashion, add the copy of N after the Nth node 
 
Now copy the random link in this fashion 

```
original->next->random= original->random->next;  
```

This works because original->next is nothing but a copy of the original and Original->random->next is nothing but a copy of the random. 
 
Now restore the original and copy linked lists in this fashion in a single loop. 

``` 
original->next = original->next->next;
copy->next = copy->next->next;
```

Ensure that original->next is NULL and return the cloned list

**Solution:**

```java
Node clone(Node start) {

    Node curr = start, temp = null;
 
    // insert additional node after
    // every node of original list
    while (curr != null) {

        temp = curr.next;
 
        // Inserting node
        curr.next = new Node(curr.data);
        curr.next.next = temp;
        curr = temp;
    }

    curr = start;
 
    // adjust the random pointers of the
    // newly added nodes
    while (curr != null) {

        if (curr.next != null) {
            curr.next.random = (curr.random != null) ? curr.random.next : curr.random;
        }

        // move to the next  node by
        curr = curr.next.next;                   
    }
 
    Node original = start, copy = start.next;
 
    // save the start of copied linked list
    temp = copy;
 
    // now separate the original list and copied list
    while (original != null) {

        original.next = original.next.next;
        copy.next = (copy.next != null) ? copy.next.next : copy.next;

        original = original.next;
        copy = copy.next;
    }

    return temp;
}
```
