## 92. Reverse Linked List II

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

**Approach:**

To reverse the linked list from position m to n, we find addresses of start and end position of the linked list by running a loop, and then we unlink this part from the rest of the list and then use the normal linked list reverse function which we have earlier used for reversing the complete linked list, and use it to reverse the portion of the linked list which need to be reversed. After reversal, we again attach the portion reversed to the main list.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        
        if (left == right) return head;
 
        ListNode revStart = null, revStartPrev = null;
        ListNode revEnd = null, revEndNext = null;
 
        // Find values of above pointers.
        int i = 1;
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null && i <= right) {
            
            if (i < left) revStartPrev = current;
 
            if (i == left) revStart = current;
 
            if (i == right) {
                revEnd = current;
                revEndNext = current.next;
            }
 
            current = current.next;
            i++;
        }
        
        // unlink
        revEnd.next = null;
 
        // Reverse linked list starting with revStart
        revEnd = reverse(revStart);
 
        // if starting position was not head
        if (revStartPrev != null) revStartPrev.next = revEnd;
        // else if starting position was head
        else head = revEnd;
 
        // reconnect
        revStart.next = revEndNext;
        
        return head;
    }
    
    public ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
        
        ListNode prev = null, current = head, next = null;
 
        while (current != null) {
            next = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = next;
        }
    
        return prev;
    }
}
```
