## 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write an efficient program to count the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer.

**Examples:** 

```
Input : n = 6
Output : 2
Binary representation of 6 is 110 and has 2 set bits
```

```
Input : n = 13
Output : 3
Binary representation of 13 is 1101 and has 3 set bits
```

**Solution:**

```java
class countSetBits {
    /* Function to get no of set
    bits in binary representation
    of positive integer n */
    static int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
 
    // driver program
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int i = 9;
        System.out.println(countSetBits(i));
    }
}
```
