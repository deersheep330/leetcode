## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive elements sequence should be [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

**Approach:**

Because it requires O(n) complexity, we can not solve the problem by sorting the array first. Sorting takes at least O(nlogn) time.

We can use a HashSet to add and remove elements. The add, remove and contains methods have constant time complexity O(1).

**Solution:**

```java
public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    for(int num: nums) set.add(num);
 
    int result = 0;
 
    for(int num: nums){
        int count = 1;
 
        int down = num-1;
        while(set.contains(down)){
            set.remove(down);
            down--;
            count++;
        }
 
        int up = num+1;
        while(set.contains(up)){
            set.remove(up);
            up++;
            count++;
        }
 
        result = Math.max(result, count);
    }
 
    return result;
}
```
