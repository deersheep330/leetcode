## 70. Climbing Stairs

There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.


**Approach:**

We can easily find the recursive nature in the above problem. The person can reach nth stair from either (n-1)th stair or from (n-2)th stair. Hence, for each stair n, we try to find out the number of ways to reach n-1th stair and n-2th stair and add them to give the answer for the nth stair. Therefore the expression for such an approach comes out to be : 

```
ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
```

The above expression is actually the expression for Fibonacci numbers, but there is one thing to notice, the value of ways(n) is equal to fibonacci(n+1). 

```
ways(1) = fib(2) = 1
ways(2) = fib(3) = 2
ways(3) = fib(4) = 3
```

**Solution:**

```java
class stairs {
    // A simple recursive program to find
    // n'th fibonacci number
    static int fib(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 1)
            return n;
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
 
    // Returns number of ways to reach s'th stair
    static int countWays(int s)
    {
        return fib(s + 1);
    }
 
    /* Driver program to test above function */
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int s = 4;
        System.out.println("Number of ways = " + countWays(s));
    }
}
```
