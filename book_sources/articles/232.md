## 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

Approach #1 (Two Stacks) Push - O(n), Pop - O(1)

Push

A queue is FIFO (first-in-first-out) but a stack is LIFO (last-in-first-out). This means the newest element must be pushed to the bottom of the stack. To do so we first transfer all s1 elements to auxiliary stack s2. Then the newly arrived element is pushed on top of s2 and all its elements are popped and pushed to s1.

Each element, with the exception of the newly arrived, is pushed and popped twice. The last inserted element is popped and pushed once. Therefore this gives 4 n + 2 operations where n is the queue size. The push and pop operations have O(1) time complexity.

Pop

The algorithm pops an element from the stack s1, because s1 stores always on its top the first inserted element in the queue. The front element of the queue is kept as front.

**Solution:**

```java
class MyQueue {
    
    private Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<>();
    private int front;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        if (s1.empty())
            front = x;
        while (!s1.isEmpty())
            s2.push(s1.pop());
        s2.push(x);
        while (!s2.isEmpty())
            s1.push(s2.pop());
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        int val = s1.pop();
        if (!s1.empty())
            front = s1.peek();
        return val;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        return front;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

**Follow-up:**

Approach #2 (Two Stacks) Push - O(1), Pop - Amortized O(1) Worst case O(n)

Push

The newly arrived element is always added on top of stack s1 and the first element is kept as front queue element

Pop

We have to remove element in front of the queue. This is the first inserted element in the stack s1 and it is positioned at the bottom of the stack because of stack's LIFO (last in - first out) policy. To remove the bottom element from s1, we have to pop all elements from s1 and to push them on to an additional stack s2, which helps us to store the elements of s1 in reversed order. This way the bottom element of s1 will be positioned on top of s2 and we can simply pop it from stack s2. Once s2 is empty, the algorithm transfer data from s1 to s2 again.

In the worst case scenario when stack s2 is empty, the algorithm pops nn elements from stack s1 and pushes n elements to s2, where nn is the queue size. This gives 2n operations, which is O(n). But when stack s2 is not empty the algorithm has O(1) time complexity.

```java
class MyQueue {
    
    private Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<>();
    private int front;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        if (s1.empty())
            front = x;
        s1.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        if (s2.isEmpty()) {
        while (!s1.isEmpty())
            s2.push(s1.pop());
        }
        return s2.pop();    
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        if (!s2.isEmpty()) {
            return s2.peek();
        }
        return front;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.isEmpty() && s2.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
