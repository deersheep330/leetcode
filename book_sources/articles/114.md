## 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.

The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

For example, Given

```
         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6
```

**Approach:**

A simple solution is to use Level Order Traversal using Queue. In level order traversal, keep track of previous node. Make current node as right child of previous and left of previous node as NULL. This solution requires queue.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        
        if (root == null) return;
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        TreeNode head = root;
        
        dfs(root, queue);
        
        // remove root from queue
        queue.poll();
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            head.right = queue.poll();
            head.left = null;
            head = head.right;
        }
    }
    
    public void dfs(TreeNode root, Queue<TreeNode> queue) {
        
        if (root == null) return;
        
	    // preorder
        queue.offer(root);
        dfs(root.left, queue);
        dfs(root.right, queue);
    }
}
```
