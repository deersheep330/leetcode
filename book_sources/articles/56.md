## 56. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Examples:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

**Approach:**

Sorting

If we sort the intervals by their start value, then each set of intervals that can be merged will appear as a contiguous "run" in the sorted list.


**Algorithm:**

First, we sort the list as described. Then, we insert the first interval into our merged list and continue considering each interval in turn as follows: If the current interval begins after the previous interval ends, then they do not overlap and we can append the current interval to merged. Otherwise, they do overlap, and we merge them by updating the end of the previous interval if it is less than the end of the current interval.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
            if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.add(interval);
            }
            // otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            // intervals.
            else {
                merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(merged.getLast()[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }
}
```
