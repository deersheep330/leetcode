## 133. Clone Graph

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

**Approach:**

The idea is to do a BFS traversal of the graph and while visiting a node make a clone node of it (a copy of original node). If a node is encountered which is already visited then it already has a clone node.

How to keep track of the visited/cloned nodes?

A HashMap/Map is required in order to maintain all the nodes which have already been created.

Key stores: Reference/Address of original Node

Value stores: Reference/Address of cloned Node

How to connect clone nodes?

While visiting the neighboring vertices of a node u get the corresponding cloned node for u , letâ€™s call that cloneNodeU , now visit all the neighboring nodes for u and for each neighbor find the corresponding clone node(if not found create one) and then push into the neighboring vector of cloneNodeU node.

**Solution:**

```java
public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
    Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
    Queue<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
 
    queue.offer(node);
    map.put(node, new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>()));
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node h = queue.poll();
 
        for (Node neighbor : h.neighbors) {
            if (!map.containsKey(neighbor)) {
                map.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val, new ArrayList<>()));
                queue.offer(neighbor);
            }
            map.get(h).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
        }
    }
 
    return map.get(node);
}
```
