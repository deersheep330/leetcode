## 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

The problem is similar to converting a decimal number to its binary representation but instead of a binary base system where we have two digits only 0 and 1, here we have 26 characters from A-Z.

So, we are dealing with base 26 instead of base binary. 

That’s not where the fun ends, we don’t have zero in this number system, as A represents 1, B represents 2 and so on Z represents 26. 

To make the problem easily understandable, we approach the problem in two steps:

1. Convert the number to base 26 representation, considering we have 0 also in the system.
2. Change the representation to the one without having 0 in its system.

HOW? Here is an example

Step 1: 

Consider we have number 676, How to get its representation in the base 26 system? The same way we do for a binary system, Instead of division and remainder by 2, we do division and remainder by 26.

Base 26 representation of 676 is : 100 

Step 2:

But Hey, we can’t have zero in our representation. Right? Because it’s not part of our number system. How do we get rid of zero? Well it’s simple, but before doing that let’s remind one simple math trick:

Subtraction: 

5000 - 9, How do you subtract 9 from 0 ? You borrow from next significant bit, right.  

In a decimal number system to deal with zero, we borrow 10 and subtract 1 from the next significant.

In Base 26 Number System to deal with zero, we borrow 26 and subtract 1 from the next significant bit.

So Convert (100)26 to a number system that does not have ‘0’, we get (25 26)26 

Symbolic representation of the same is: YZ 

**Solution:**

```java
class GFG{
 
    static void printString(int n)
    {
        int []arr = new int[10000];
        int i = 0;
 
        // Step 1: Converting to number
        // assuming 0 in number system
        while (n > 0)
        {
            arr[i] = n % 26;
            n = n / 26;
            i++;
        }
 
        // Step 2: Getting rid of 0, as 0 is
        // not part of number system
        for(int j = 0; j < i - 1; j++)
        {
            if (arr[j] <= 0)
            {
                arr[j] += 26;
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1] - 1;
            }
        }
 
        for(int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
        {
            if (arr[j] > 0) System.out.print((char)('A' + arr[j] - 1));
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
 
    // Driver code
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        printString(26);
        printString(51);
        printString(52);
        printString(80);
        printString(676);
        printString(702);
        printString(705);
    }
}
```
