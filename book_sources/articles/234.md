## 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given a singly linked list of characters, write a function that returns true if the given list is a palindrome, else false.

**Approach:**

A simple solution is to use a stack of list nodes. This mainly involves three steps.

1. Traverse the given list from head to tail and push every visited node to stack.
2. Traverse the list again. For every visited node, pop a node from the stack and compare data of popped node with the currently visited node.
3. If all nodes matched, then return true, else false.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current = head;
        boolean ispalin = true;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
 
        while (current != null) {
            stack.push(current.val);
            current = current.next;
        }
 
        while (head != null) {
 
            int i = stack.pop();
            if (head.val == i) {
                ispalin = true;
            }
            else {
                ispalin = false;
                break;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        return ispalin;
    }
    
}
```

Using Recursion

Use two pointers left and right. Move right and left using recursion and check for following in each recursive call. 

1) Sub-list is a palindrome. 
2) Value at current left and right are matching.

If both above conditions are true then return true.

The idea is to use function call stack as a container. Recursively traverse till the end of list. When we return from last NULL, we will be at the last node. The last node to be compared with first node of list.

```java
class Solution {
    
    ListNode left;
    
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        left = head;
        boolean result = helper(head);
        return result;
    }
    
    public boolean helper(ListNode right){
 
        //stop recursion
        if (right == null)
            return true;
 
        //if sub-list is not palindrome,  return false
        boolean x = helper(right.next);
        if (!x)
            return false;
 
        //current left and right
        boolean y = (left.val == right.val);
 
        //move left to next
        left = left.next;
 
        return y;
    }
}
```
