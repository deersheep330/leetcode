## 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: array = [1, 5, 4, 3]

Output: 6

Explanation : 
5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. 
So the size of the base = 2. 
Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. 
So total area = 3 * 2 = 6
```

```
Input: array = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]

Output: 12

Explanation : 
5 and 3 are distance 4 apart. 
So the size of the base = 4. 
Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. 
So total area = 4 * 3 = 12
```

**Approach:**

Start with the first and last element and check the amount of water that can be contained and store that container. Now the question arises is there any better boundaries or lines that can contain maximum water. So there is a clever way to find that. Initially, there are two indices the first and last index pointing to the first and the last element (which acts as boundaries of the container), if the value first index is less than the last index increase the first index else decrease the last index. 

**Solution:**

```java
class Area{
 
    public static int maxArea(int A[], int len)
    {
        int l = 0;
        int r = len -1;
        int area = 0;
     
        while (l < r)
        {
            // Calculating the max area
            area = Math.max(area,
                        Math.min(A[l], A[r]) * (r - l));
                         
            if (A[l] < A[r])
                l += 1;
                 
            else
                r -= 1;
        }
        return area;
    }
     
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a[] = {1, 5, 4, 3};
        int b[] = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
     
        int len1 = 4;
        System.out.print( maxArea(a, len1)+"\n" );
     
        int len2 = 5;
        System.out.print( maxArea(b, len2) );
    }
}
```
