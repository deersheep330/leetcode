## 137. Single Number II

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

**Solution:**

```java
public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
  int ones = 0, twos = 0, threes = 0;
        
  for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // twos holds the num that appears twice
    twos |= ones & nums[i];
    
    // ones holds the num that appears once
    ones ^= nums[i];
 
    // threes holds the num that appears three times
    threes = ones & twos;
            
    // if num[i] appears three times
    // doing this will clear ones and twos
    ones &= ~threes;
    twos &= ~threes;
  }
        
  return ones;
}
```
