## 69. Sqrt(x)

The idea is to find the largest integer i whose square is less than or equal to the given number. 

The idea is to use Binary Search to solve the problem. 

The values of i * i is monotonically increasing, so the problem can be solved using binary search. 

**Algorithm:**

1. Take care of some base cases, i.e when the given number is 0 or 1.
2. Create some variables, lowerbound l = 0, upperbound r = n, where n is the given number, mid and ans to store the answer.
3. Run a loop until l <= r , the search space vanishes
4. Check if the square of mid (mid = (l + r)/2 ) is less than or equal to n, If yes then search for a larger value in second half of search space, i.e l = mid + 1, update ans = mid
5. Else if the square of mid is more than n then search for a smaller value in first half of search space, i.e r = mid â€“ 1
6. Print the value of answer (ans)

**Solution:**

```java
public class Test
{
    public static int floorSqrt(int x)
    {
        // Base Cases
        if (x == 0 || x == 1)
            return x;
  
  
        // Do Binary Search for floor(sqrt(x))
        long start = 1, end = x, ans=0;
        while (start <= end)
        {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
  
            // If x is a perfect square
            if (mid*mid == x)
                return (int)mid;
  
            // Since we need floor, we update answer when mid*mid is
            // smaller than x, and move closer to sqrt(x)
            if (mid*mid < x)
            {
                start = mid + 1;
                ans = mid;
            }
            else   // If mid*mid is greater than x
                end = mid-1;
        }
        return (int)ans;
    }
  
    // Driver Method
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int x = 11;
        System.out.println(floorSqrt(x));
    }
}
