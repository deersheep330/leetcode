## 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Examples:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Approach:**

The best solution is to use XOR. XOR of all array elements gives us the number with a single occurrence. The idea is based on the following two facts. 

a) XOR of a number with itself is 0. 
b) XOR of a number with 0 is number itself.

Let us consider the above example.  
Let ^ be xor operator as in C and C++.

```
res = 7 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 4
```

Since XOR is associative and commutative, above expression can be written as:

```
res = 7 ^ (3 ^ 3) ^ (4 ^ 4) ^ (5 ^ 5)  
    = 7 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0
    = 7 ^ 0
    = 7 
```

**Solution:**

```java
class MaxSum
{
    // Return the maximum Sum of difference
    // between consecutive elements.
    static int findSingle(int ar[], int ar_size)
    {
        // Do XOR of all elements and return
        int res = ar[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < ar_size; i++)
            res = res ^ ar[i];
     
        return res;
    }
 
    // Driver code
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int ar[] = {2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4};
        int n = ar.length;
        System.out.println("Element occurring once is " +
                            findSingle(ar, n) + " ");
    }
}
```
